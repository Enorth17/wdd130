        <p>I shared a picture of me and my husband on our wedding day. We were married 6 months ago and are living here in Rexburg! He's premed, and I'm majoring in Marketing.</p>
        <p>I am very nervous to learn about web desgin but I'm also excited for the challenge. I hope to use it in a marketing degree to have an extra skill on a resume after school.</p>
